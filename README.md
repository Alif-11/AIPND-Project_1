This repo hosts my work for the first project of the Artificial Intelligence Programming with Python Nanodegree Program. This project revolved around using a pertained image classifier to classify images of animals into dogs and not dogs, as well as to identify the breed of dog in the picture. We tested three CNN models - vgg, alexnet, and resnet.

This project took around 10 hours to complete. All the auxiliary python programs that will be mentioned below were ran in the driver file check_images.py

My work revolved around:
* Recording the time it took for the entire program to execute, using the time module.
* Handling user inputs ((string) the path image directory where the user's dog images are stored, (string) the name of the CNN model used, (string) the list of valid dog breed names to be used in checking if an identified photo is a dog breed. I also provided default values in case the user decided not to
