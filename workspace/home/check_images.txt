Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: The three models did classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed. For reference, the dog breed I chose for my Dog_01.jpg file was a golden retriever, and all three models classified the dog in the picture as a golden retriever.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: None of the models classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed the model classified for the upside down dog in Dog_02.jpg. Alexnet reported Dog_02 to be a koala bear. Vgg reported Dog_02 to be an afghan hound. Resnet reported Dog_02 to be a llama. Thus, the vgg model was the only model that classified Dog_02 as a dog. The other two models believed Dog_02 was another species of animal.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: For the Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg files, all three models correctly classified the images to be not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Since the models all classified the breed Dog_01 correctly, and stated the Object_Name_01 and Animal_Name_01 files were not dogs, I have to pick the model that I thought did best at classifying the four images based on my response to question 2. Since the vgg model was the only model that thought Dog_02 was a dog, I have to select that model as the best on uploaded image classification.
